**Title**: [Smoke Gets in Your Eyes: And Other Lessons from the Crematory](https://www.goodreads.com/book/show/25189315-smoke-gets-in-your-eyes)

**Author**: [Caitlin Doughty](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Caitlin_Doughty)

**Pages**: 254

**Should you read or not?  Yes, if death discomforts you!**

Caitlin Doughty, a mortician, hailing from Hawaii, has penned her experience of working into a crematory (well, the title kinda shouts it in your face). What makes the memoir particularly engaging is the author's blunt expression of her interest in 'death', as a character, a subject, and a profession. She begins her story, of her relationship with death, in the eighth year of her life, with a thud of a little girl falling from 30 feet, face-first onto the floor, in a shopping mall. The memoir is laced with both her experiences and thoughts on death! Questions like it took her a whole eight years to witness her first death, also makes the reader hunt their past for the same experience. (And, more often than not, one would find out that indeed it took them way too long before they realized what death was!) Her stories of the funerary practices visit the mortuary cannibalism of the Wariʼ, the holy Ganges where the poor just drown their corpses, and the mania of beautifying the corpses in the modern western world. She elaborates on the practices of embalming, on how families pay fortunes, to see their dead, in a way, they would never want them to see! In between, she highlights her struggle with her own life, her encounter with the reality of the death of her loved ones, and so on! She also shares her journey at the mortuary school (yes they exist!) and what and how they teach.

That's all one could say without spoiling the book for a prospective reader!

As for the reading experience, it might not give you a euphoric high but, it is intriguing enough to keep you gripped. And surprisingly it is not as unpleasant, as the topic itself! And for sure, it will make you a tad-bit comfortable with the holy subject matter of something that is always talked of in hushed words--death!

Finally parting with a few lines (quotes?) of what I found beautiful, thoughtful, and interesting. All at once.

> Looking mortality straight in the eye is no easy feat. To avoid the exercise, we choose to stay blindfolded, in the dark as to the realities of death and dying. But ignorance is not bliss, only a deeper kind of terror.

>As the great cultural anthropologist Ernest Becker said, “The idea of death, the fear of it, haunts the human animal like nothing else.

>There is a Japanese myth that tells of the descent of Izanagi into the underworld to find his sister, Izanami. When he finds her, she tells him that she will return with him to the world of the living, but—in a parallel to the Western myth of Orpheus—under no circumstances should he look at her. Izanagi is impatient, and lights a torch to see her. The torchlight reveals Izanami’s corpse, rotting and covered in maggots. She attempts to chase her brother, but he draws a giant rock between them so they are separated forever. No longer ignorant of death, Izanagi must place the rock to shield him from his own thoughts, now filled with the horrors he discovered.

>The rules of the game were arbitrary but did not feel irrational.

>I thought it made the contents more upbeat, but in retrospect it probably increased the creepy factor tenfold.

>Quick to prove myself useful, I asked in a solemn tone, “Were you her husband?” “Young lady, I am her husband. Not were her husband,” he replied, fixing me with a withering gaze, compounded by the forty other withering gazes from around the room.

>“Look, Cat, we see people at their worst moments. Maybe if someone’s buying a new car, or a new house, they want to be there. But what are they buying from us? Nothing, we’re charging money to take away someone they love. That’s the last thing in the world they want.” This made me feel better.

>But times have changed, and these days, of the half a million people who die each year in the UK, only 18 per cent die in their home (although 60 per cent say they would like to, given the choice).

>When we knocked, a dark-haired woman in her fifties opened the door. I gave her a big, sincere smile, having learned at that point that a sincere smile was more effective than faked sympathy.

>There are so many of these corpses in the river that the Indian government releases thousands of flesh-eating turtles to chomp away at the “necrotic pollutants.”

>Tibetans have developed another method of dealing with their dead. A professional rogyapa, or body breaker, slices the flesh off the corpse and grinds the remaining bones with barley flour and yak butter. The body is laid out on a high, flat rock to be eaten by vultures. The birds swoop in, carrying the body in all different directions, up into the sky. It is a generous way to be disposed of, the leftover flesh nourishing other animals.

>“For you are dust, and to dust you shall return.”

>Even if all we love will die, I still ached for a love like theirs, to be adored so completely.

>The Portuguese have a word with no equivalent in English, saudade, which indicates a longing, tinged with nostalgia, madness, and sickness over something you have lost.

>The only thing that’s certain is that nothing ever is.

>This slow decline differs sharply from times past, when people tended to die quickly, often in a single day. Post-mortem daguerreotypes from the 1800s picture fresh, young, almost lifelike corpses, many of them victims of scarlet fever or diphtheria. In 1899, a mere 4 per cent of the US population was over sixty-five—forget making it to eighty-five.

>As Kafka said, “The meaning of life is that it ends.”

>Buddhists say that thoughts are like drops of water on the brain; when you reinforce the same thought, it will etch a new stream into your consciousness, like water eroding the side of a mountain. Scientists confirm this bit of folk wisdom: our neurons break connections and form new pathways all the time. Even if you’ve been programmed to fear death, that particular pathway isn’t set in stone. Each of us is responsible for seeking out new knowledge and creating new mental circuits.

>“There are no new ideas. There are only new ways of making them felt.”

And, somewhere between the full stops and commas of the last one lies the genesis of this blog!
