<p>This is your birthday wall! You can decorate it the way you like. Here, you can write anything about yourself (yes!! a birthday note) and this day. Such as something special you feel about the occasion, something you are grateful for, the warm wishes you receive from people, the photos, the gifts you got, and of-course the cake celebration. This is a memory wall for this special day and similar days to come.</p>
